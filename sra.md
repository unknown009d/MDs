# Plan of action

Good morning to sir/madam,

The topic that am going to discuss with you now is about our plan for the chatbot developement. We are going to use HTML5 (Hyper-Text Markup Language), CSS3 (Cascading Stylesheet), JavaScript at the Front-end and Python with chatterbot library at Back-end with a Flask server.

## Concepts we will be using :
- Using python with API is for better performance and less traffic on the server.
- API will also help in different platforms (for eg. Android, iOS)
- Design will be done with pure HTML and CSS
- Chatterbot is a python library for Chat bots
- Chatterbot corpus is a traning dataset for some pre defined conversation
- Machine Learning will be used in this project

## Work load distribution
- AMAYEKA DEB will provide dataset collection/conversation for chatterbot traning
- NISHAMPLI DEBBARMA will manage the Server with Flask
- MICLE DEBBARMA will be doing the Python developement with chatterbot
- DRUBAJYOTI DEBNATH has been assigned for Front-end designing and scripting (UI/UX)
- Me Sraban saha is responsible for Testing of the database and the application
